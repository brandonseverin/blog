      <li>Signal is jammed:
        <ul>
          <li>civilian code vs military code</li>
          <li>civilian code is over a narrow band width</li>

  <li>laws of nature vs manufacture limitations</li>
  <li>Oscillator, reference medium, detector feedback mechanism
    <ul>
      <li>making a reference medium is a little tricky</li>
      <li>N in C60 —&gt; nature’s atom trap</li>
      <li>The N atom doesn’t bond, it just floats in the middle of the cage. It is a bit squashed but behaves like a free atom
        <ul>
          <li>offers protection of spin states due to cage.</li>
          <li>50us coherence time at room temperature</li>
          <li>But if your magnetic field changes your spin state frequency changes. So you need the magnetic field to be as accurate as the clock</li>
          <li>You also have to think about the nuclear spin:
            <ul>
              <li>If you sit at the minimum of the transition field you no longer depend on magnetic field - The clock field</li>

  <li>Need to improve the line width of the absorption of the C60 at the clock transition by a factor of 1000.</li>
  <li>LocatorX - company willing to put money</li>
  <li>What is limiting the line width of the clock transition? - we don’t know
    <ul>
      <li>It seems to be limited by the magnetic modulation to get a signal strong enough to measure.</li>
      <li>The next step is to measure line width at the clock transition</li>

<ul>
  <li>Starting small, two photons coming into the beam splitter.
    <ul>
      <li>You’d expect them to come out the same port 50% of the time as classical particles</li>
      <li>But you get quantum interference</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What happens with more photons?
    <ul>
      <li>independent single photons , elastic scattering, no interaction</li>
      <li>Feasible quantum advantage</li>

<ul>
  <li>what do clocks do?
They measure coincidences between local events here and now. Must specify the temperature of the local environment</li>
  <li>Physical time is relational - time is always local.</li>
  <li>The larger the limit cycle the more regular the clock signal. But the larger the limit cycle the more energy is dissipated.</li>
  <li>Good clocks are necessarily dissipative Erker PRX 2017</li>
  <li>Entropy increases into the future and into the past from the perspective of a local agent. Physical time is manifest time.</li>
  <li>learning machines - they are driven to learn because that is the most efficient way to exploit their thermodynamic environment.</li>
  <li>Heat and entropy must be dissipated during training</li>
  <li>too much noise, random number generator basically</li>
  <li>quantum perceptron is a dissipative switch subject to quantum noise</li>
  <li>Thermodynamic efficiency of learning a rule in neural networks. Nothing done in the quantum case yet.</li>
  <li>Akil Seth - the brain isn’t a video recorder. It takes in what it observes, forms an emulation and continuously updates its own emulation based on more information input.</li>
  <li>What if communication between agents is more efficient than learning individually</li>
  <li>Spiking is always a bit better</li>
  <li>what are the laws of physics</li>

<p>Three questions</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wigner’s friend</li>
  <li>Entanglement</li>
  <li>Teleportation</li>
</ul>

<p>Does consciousness collapse quantum states?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ooh a qubit in a superposition state. If I observe it, i’ll project its state.</li>
  <li>Against measurement - John Bell. Would you get a better measurement if the person had a phd</li>
  <li>are frogs conscious - can frogs be entangled</li>
  <li>can consciousness be teleported</li>
  <li>you can’t have consciousness without learning but you can’t have learning without irreversibility.</li>
</ul>

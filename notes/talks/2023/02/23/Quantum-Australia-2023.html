Peter Rohde, Senior Lecturer, UTS;Gavin Brennen, Professor, Macquarie University (Panel Chair)    - you don’t just a cryptographic system to be secure. You also want it to work.</p>
<ul>
  <li>a quantum network will be more sparse than classical Mensing it may be possible to cut nodes of the network off due to reduced oath redundancy</li>
  <li>bear in mind QKD will be used to protect precisely the things that you don’t want to cut off</li>
  <li>QKD doesn’t meet the assurance requirements of most western governments at the moment. PQC is the future more than QKD. PQC can be used in a hybrid manner and QKD could be used to complement classical things</li>
  <li>want to be able to change the underlying encryption algorithm when you need to. This is hard.</li>
  <li>organising an full upgrade of any organisation will be very hard. It may take decades for many organisations and will be continual learning from their mistakes. Improvements will be gradual.</li>
  <li>how paranoid should we be with PQC? Is it as safe as we believe it to be.</li>
  <li>will need to consider the cost of an attack, may not be worth it.</li>
  <li>quantum internet and computing. Homomorphic encryption and blind computing. You don’t want the person performing your computation to know what you’re computing. Can be done with relatively little overhead if you have a quantum encryption network. Important as the things we’d be computing are likely to have high value implications.</li>
  <li>Decentralised quantum computing.</li>
  <li>should we trust nation states with the security of quantum cryptography in terms of back doors.</li>
  <li>looking for hashing collisions.</li>
  <li>Hashing algorithms are secure by doubling the key length## Michael Cuthbert, Director, National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC) UK- see their role as not trying to do everything themselves. Want international collaboration and accelerate the roadmap for the wider ecosystem</li>
  <li>establishing a new national laboratory</li>
  <li>build consensus, don’t assume that their is a clear or shared vision amongst key stake holders</li>

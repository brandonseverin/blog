## Inspired by nature, building on spin - Christiane Timmel
- hypothesis: magneto sensitive radical pairs are formed in light sensitive proteins, aka crypto chromes

- controlling psin in molecular wires
    - controlling and quantifying spin localisation and delocalisation by design, synthesis and EPR
    - can change geometry of system as well
    - quantum interference in molecular rings
        - cut the rings up to select electron pathways
        - the exchang ealong two paths is the same as the exchange along 4 single paths
- Oxford is world leading in the understanding of cryptochorms and there importance in bird migration.

## Aleks Kissinger - Quantum computing meets computer science
- seen before on the IBM workshop day

## Quantum chemistry in the era of quantum computers - David Tew
- in silicon prediction - solve the schordinger equation of the nuclei as well as you can so you and understand the phenomena 

## Dorian Gangloff
- used my figure, :rofl:

## Dominic O’Brien - Engineering quantum technologies

- short range indoor links: polarisation based quantum schemes
    - symmetric encryption key
- Challenges of quantum key distribution in free space: 
    - daylight swamps the signal,
        - wavelengths in quiet regions 
        - tricky to get these links secure
        - people can do it between satellites, but the key rates are really slow
- Hardware: MEMS mirror based beam streaming
- Entaglement QKDs
    - David Lucas, Ion traps
- Dynamic optics and photonics groups
    - use lasers to for fabrication inside transparent materials
    - want to minimise cross talk between fabricated wave guides.
    - write single NV centres in diamond, using direct fluorescent feedback for high yield and positioning accuracy
    - Can build in stress fields. 

- what do people what to use quantum key distribution for - QKD offers a level of security to post quantum digital algorithms. Commercial world see as part of the whole quantum security picture.

## Peter Leek - superconducting quantum technology
- how do we build a quantum computer out of electric circuits as we know them
    - LC resonators, don’t want resistors as they are associated with information loss
        - physics of them is a mass on a spring
    - need a macroscopic quantum ground state and low dissipation high q circuits for quantum coherence
        - superconductors
        - good microwave engineering
            - reduce dissipation
    - get very close to the ground state - remove thermal excitations
        - kT < hw 
            - high frequencies and low T (10mK)
- linear resonator and equally spaced levels are not a qubit
- by using josephson junction we can create a effective non-linear resonator which creates unequally spaced levels
- tillable low cross-talk 3d-integrated superconducting circuits
- operate at microwave frequencies, as you scale up your chip the box your chip is in also operates modes at microwave frequencies - need to short circuits across the volume to fix this and maintain coherence.
- 16 qubits, want to operate at 4 9s fidelity 99.99%
- Scaling challenge: we can convince themselves they can get to a certain scale (1000) in a fridge, then you need microwave to microwave optical conversion between fridges.

## David Lucas - Ion trap technologies

- atom ion in a trap is a mass on spring, in megahertz regime.
- DIQKD challenge, need high number of Bell pairs and high fidelity.
- quantum networking experimental setup
    - optical clocks

## Quantum Matter - Experimental Frontiers - Seamus Davis
- bosons and fermions
    - Bosons: swap you don’t change the sign by minus 1
    - Fermions: you do change the sign
- Refrigerate bosons —> collapse into a single quantum state —> bose-einstein quantum state
- Refrigerate fermions —> they pair up --> superconductivity 

Correlated electron metal - Consider the Coulomb interaction within the metals and you find that the structure changes (MOTT) / HUND correlated metals

## Mark Friesen | Wiggle Well: engineering valley and spin-orbit properties of silicon 

- wiggle well solves two problems related to scale up
    - reliably large valley splitting 
    - large intrinsic spin-orbit coupling without micromagnets
- Valley splitting variations are very large
    - 
- Valley vs spin qubits
    - quantum dot qubits are formed at the very bottom of the conduction band in silicon, 
    - Note conduction band minimum doesn't fall within the center of the brillouin zone
    - two valleys form - the valley states compete with the spin as a possible qubit. 2x2-fold energy level degeneracy in a quantum well
    -if the valley splitting is very small, relative to the zeeman splitting then the valley will be the qubit rather than the spin
    - Want sharp interfaces and narrow quantum wells to increase the valley splitting but there is still large variability. 0.33nm sharp interface
- Shape of the dot changes but not the location
- Valley splitting behaviour is fully explained by alloy disorder of random Si-Ge alloying
- Variability occurs because the dot samples fluctuations differently at different locations
- Concentration fluctuations have a small component of short-period wiggle well

### Best schemes for valley splitting
- deterministic scheme: find a way to grow the short-period wiggle well
- randomly dominated scheme: add uniform Ge to the quantum well and find a way to reposition the dot

### Scale-up problem (2): weak spin-orbit coupling in Si
- Electrically Driven spin resonance with a micromagnet
    - fab a micromagnet on top of the dot, drive it electrically
- EDSR via spin-orbit coupling (Rashba 1960s)
- Experimental suggestion of spin orbit coupling in wiggle well because g-factor is not equal to 2.
-sp3d5s theory predicts large enhancements of dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling

### Conclusions
- wiggle wells exist
- enhancing valley splitting
    - deterministic strategy short-period WWW
    - Randomly dominated strategy: Ge in the quantum well; reposition dot
- Enhancing spin-orbit coupling
    - deterministic strategy: long-period wiggle well

## Kristiaan De Greve (imec) | Si spin qubits fabricated in advanced, industry-standard CMOS facilities: state of the art and outlook

- novel integration 
- Si MOS
    - best for valley splitting , worst for charge noise due to oxide interface and defects
- Si/SiGe
    - worst for valley splitting, best for charge noise
- Interface characterisation via Hall 
    - can be done at relatively higher T
    - fast measurements
    - process optimization

## Martin Kiffner - calculating intermolecular dispersion energies with quantum processors

### London dispersion forces:
- fluctuating dipoles  - correlated multipole moments 
    - exchange of virtual photon pairs
- small correction to gross energy structure
- not pairwise additive
    - need to study the whole ensemble of the molecules to find a meaningful answer
- Although small - important for supramolecular chemistry, structural biology, nano tech etc. 

### How to approach this problem
- Ab-initio e.g. DFT
    - try and solve the schrodinger equation, computationally very demanding
- Empirical methods
    - cheap 
    - but not very accurate,
- Electric coarse graining
    - pair of 1D harmonic oscillator 
        - Parameters: coupling, polarisability, separation, ground state energy
        - match model parameters to molecular species
    - Simple system, but still quantum do naturally reproduce dispersion forces

### Quantum Algorithm
- Variational Quantum Eigensolver method
- For each oscillator, take into account d number of Fock states
- Need log2d qubits - each oscillator is represented by two qubits
- need to prepare each harmonic oscillator into a given quantum state
- number of unique circuits scales linearly with the number of molecules
- You have a classical algorithm on top of the quantum computer that picks a subset of parameters to feed back into the quantum computer
    - details in the paper (L. W. Anderson Phys Rev. A 105 2022)

### Results
- Two iodine molecules (non-polar, strong London forces)
- reasonable fit between quantum (ibm-montreal/simulated) calc and theoretical results

### Features
- number of qubits grows linearly with number of molecules
- number of uniques circuits measuring the hamiltonian of all-to-all dipolar interaction scales linearly with the number of molecules
- relatively cheap to extend quantum algorithm to an-harmonic molecule unlike classical coarse-grained counterpart


## Aleks Kissinger - Picturing Quantum Software

- code that makes that code better
    - compilers
    - optimisation
    - vectorisation

- small advances in software give big gains on NISQ hardware

- quantum circuits are the assembly language of quantum computation
    - how to make quantum circuits more efficient
    - cut gates open and find things that are more fundamental inside
    - replace gates with ZX-diagram
        - made of spiders
        - two kinds
        - can make any quantum circuit from two basic spiders
        - small set of rules (8 rules) - imply hundreds of circuit identities
        - can realise in a much simpler circuit diagram
- How do we scale up?
    - GitHub.com/quantomatic/pyzx
    - python library
    - scale large circuit down to skeleton, take skeleton and expand into a simpler circuit than previously
        - have flexibility in the latter step, circuit routing
        - extract circuits based on Gaussian elimination

### application
- T-count reduction, reduce the number of T-gates in a quantum circuit
    - reduce T-gates as they are much more overhead in fault-tolerant quantum computing
    - extremely important for long-term fault-tolerant QC (optimistically 20 years away)
    - matters today: simulating quantum circuits on a classical computer 
        - classical simulation is hard
        - more qubits, the harder to simulate
        - the more entanglement between the qubits the harder it is to simulate
        - the more t-gates, the harder to simulated - as it is far from something that is easy to simulate
            - stabilarizer rank decomposition: simulate difficult circuits as a sum of simple circuits
            - If there aren’t too many terms you can use gauss-mania theorem
            - decomposing each T gate into 2 stabiliser terms, gives 2^t terms
        - interleave decomposition with zx-simplifications
            - 1400 t-gates, age of uni verse to simulate, can be broken down with zx-simulation to 6 minutes

## Daniel Egger - quantum computing and its applications to optimisation and finance

### why quantum
- still problems we can’t solve

- computation model in a nutshell
    - initial state
    - sta evolves following a sequence of ops
    - measure state at end
## Applications
- machine learning
    - classification task
        - fraud detection, credit risk rating, customer segmentation
    - feature map, classical support vector machine
    - can apply a quantum feature map, a feature map that can’t be calculated efficiently on classical machine
        - can leverage entanglement to find correlations between features in a quantum feature map
        - increase accuracy of classification, not necessarily faster
    - quantum neural networks
        - a bit more expressive, 
        - train a lot faster
        - brining quantities like entanglement trains to lower losses faster, ibm montreal backend

Combinatorial optimisation
- portfolio optimisation efficient frontier
    - max risk, minimise return
- binary decision variables\
- MAXCUT
- take optimisation problem and transform to Ising Hamiltonians to GS problem 
    - Hamiltonian corresponds to optimisation problem, ground state of hamiltonian is the solution
- heuristic may find better solutions faster

Transaction settlement
- clearing house that receives trades, which trades will settle, certain parties may not have the resources to settle the trades
- mixed binary optimisation problem
- enables new application such as transaction settlement

When does this become relevant
- what gate fidelities do we need - need to be high, lol
- how fast 
- where are the bottlenecks
- 
leveraging best classical eigensolvers


Financial simulations
- risk analysis with a quantum computer
- monte carlo simulation on Q for pricing and risk analysis
    - estimate expected value 
    - value at risk
    - conditional value at risk
    - scales 2x
- Can rely on Amplitude estimation giving you a quadratic speed-up
- Option pricing
    - what system size for practical advantage, 7500 logical qubits :upside_down_smile:
    - error correcting code needs to be 3 order of magnitude faster :sweat_smile:

## Pauline Ollitrault - Molecular quantum dynamics: a quantum computing perspective

- born-oppenheimer approx: separation go the electronic and nuclear DOFs based on the different time-scalee for their respective motion
    - solve electrons and nuclei individually
- classical approaches and limitations
    - we can do pyridine accurately, that is the current limit
- quantum algorithms for quantum dynamics simulations
    - solve electronic structure
    - solve tie evolution Schodinger equation based on previously attained electronic structure

### time dependent Schodinger
- decomposition methods
    - map to quantum circuit
    - requires no ancillary qubits
    - leads to shorter quantum circuits
- Variational methods
    - don’t encode time propagator
    - encode a trial state, 
        - solve the parameters’ equations of motion and adjust them (built classically and measured classically)
        - measure
        - iterate
- Grid based non-adiabatic QD
- Requires lots of measurements, 
    - 120 qubits, trotter formula 10^7 2-qubit gates, 1s run time
    - 10^5 2-qubits gates in variational approach, 10^15s run time
    - :sweat_smile:

- interesting thing using a variational algorithm is that you can just prepare your wave function and go. 

- particle colliding with a nickel barrier
    - correct dynamics are always recovered by increasing the number of parameters - algorithm increases exponentially

- going beyond born-oppenheimer and treat both electrons and nuclei degrees of freedom on the same level

## Hendrik Hamann - Accelerated discovery for climate sustainability 

- global emission rated will reach 80 Gt CO2/year by 2075

    - Turing test: a model is good enough when you can’t distinguish the model from the observation

### Ship tracking based on aerosols
- Every cloud droplet forms on an aerosol particle, more pollution means more cloud droplets - want to find the affect of aerosols on models/climate
    - difficult to tell based on cloud brightness from satellite data

### Menu
- contect, materials and methods
- lithium battery materials
- beyond lithium ions
- perovskite solar cells

### Context
- both materials and tech
- issues, is characterisation and deeper understanding
    - modelling is crucial to understand crystal structure
    - **how do ions move**
    - defects and disorder: “Like people, solids are imperfect - making them unique & interesting”
        - “Like solids some people have more defects than others” Boris?
    - doping in the crystal lattice
    - surfaces and interfaces, grain boundaries of nano(materials)
- DFT stuff done on national supercomputers such as archer2
    - can we use AI and machine learning to bridge multi scale modelling
- Lithium battery is a success story of materials science and chemistry in action. 
- are we on the cusp of an electric vehicle revolution
    - first lead acid, Ni-Cd, Ni-MH now Li-ion, where next?

### Challenge
- the positive electrode of the battery (cathode)
- energy density of the cathode is half that of the graphite anode
    - the storage capacity is not as high as it could be
- Looking at new materials such as
    - Li-rich NMC (stuff more Li in current NMC)
    - DRS - disordered rock salts (approaching graphite anode density)
    - from a chemos point of view, they are using anion redox methods (cooooool). Invoking metal redox as well as an-ion redox to increase energy density
        - the redox chemistry of DRS involves O2 formation
    - Want to produce stable oxygen containing cathodes

### How fast can you charge
- how fast ions move across the lattice is related to charging speed, but many don’t know how they move across the lattice.
    - Modelling the Li-ion moving across the lattice can give insights
    - diffusion rates can be derived
- Can we leave Cobalt behind for Iron based cathodes (Li Iron phosphate)
    - Li-ions move through the structure, via a curved 1D path. predicted via modelling and shown via experiment

### All solid state
- can we replace flammable liquid electrolyte with solid electrolyte
    - fundamentals of inorganic solid states electrolytes for batteries - nature materials review
- Sodium batteries, abundant and low cost, good for storage for grid

### Solar energy
- Perovskite cell predicted to overtake silicon in terms of solar cell efficiency based on extrapolation (based on past 10 years)
    - cheap to make 
    - Problem: stability and ion migration , wasn’t known what ions move in 2014
    - Mixed ionic -electronic structure, it was the iodide vacancy that moved

### Question, why does capacity degrade over time?
- rearragement in structure of materials
- lose oxygen from the cathode over time

### Question: ML application in which part of the process?
- take data from DFT to influence molecular dynamics simulations via machine learning


## Volker Deringer - Machine-learning-drive advances in atomic scale materials modelling

- we want to know the energy of a system of where the atoms are - draw an energy potential surface about the structure
    - we can only do this at a few points as the calculations are very demanding
    - can use data based approaches, get a few points along the surface and predict the rest

How do we build these interatomic potential force field models
- reference data - need the correct data
- representations (descriptors) - the way you encode the atomistic structure
- Regression (the fit itself) 
    - neural network based methods
    - kernel methods - compare prediction based on known methods (detail not in this talk :()
    - linear fitting 

### what now - we want to see things we haven’t seen before
- can we build general purpose machine learning force fields
- 10nm long amorphous silicon
    - take melted silicon cool it down slowly
        - trace the change in coordination number
        - can validate based on experiment - good matching
- can understand structural transitions under pressure
    - can see phase change
    - crystallinity formation and grain boundaries
    - 10nm crystal :fire:

### de novo exploration and ML force field fitting
- take atoms at random and use ML model to fit structure to atomic make up
- test run alpha-boron
    - number of DFT evaluations 2000
- structure of amorphous (red) phosphorus 

### putting things into practise
- porous electrode materials - carbon revisited
- ML driven simulations can predict voltage curves, how the charges change locally over time.

don’t want to replace quantum mechanics, just want to include ml-dft models as part of the process and feedback.

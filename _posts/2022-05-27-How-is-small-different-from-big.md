## Edward Laird - Atomic clock in your pocket
- Portable time keeping then and now
    - Th Scilly Naval disaster 1704, needed access to an accurate chronometer
- GPS 
    - 10ns <-> 30m location, doesn’t need an accurate clock
    - time keeping needed to make it resistant
    - One satellite goes down
    - Signal is jammed:
        - civilian code vs military code
        - civilian code is over a narrow band width
- GPS denied env, 
- caesium, rubidium, quartz crystal: 10^-16, 10^-12, 10^-9
 Principles of an atomic clock
- laws of nature vs manufacture limitations
- Oscillator, reference medium, detector feedback mechanism
    - making a reference medium is a little tricky
    - N in C60 —> nature’s atom trap
    - The N atom doesn’t bond, it just floats in the middle of the cage. It is a bit squashed but behaves like a free atom
        - offers protection of spin states due to cage.
        - 50us coherence time at room temperature
        - But if your magnetic field changes your spin state frequency changes. So you need the magnetic field to be as accurate as the clock
        - You also have to think about the nuclear spin:
            - If you sit at the minimum of the transition field you no longer depend on magnetic field - The clock field
- Kyriakos: Synthesis N in C60 like clay pigeon shooting, yield of 0.6%
- Need to improve the line width of the absorption of the C60 at the clock transition by a factor of 1000.
- LocatorX - company willing to put money 
- What is limiting the line width of the clock transition? - we don’t know
    - It seems to be limited by the magnetic modulation to get a signal strong enough to measure. 
    - The next step is to measure line width at the clock transition
- Gerrard: how about optically trapping the molecules, maybe even at vacuum

## Ian Walmsley - How is big different than small? Shedding light on complexity.
- Starting small, two photons coming into the beam splitter.
    - You’d expect them to come out the same port 50% of the time as classical particles
    - But you get quantum interference
- What happens with more photons?
    - independent single photons , elastic scattering, no interaction
    - Feasible quantum advantage
- S Aaronson’s blog: Shtetl Optimised
He has been eight years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers.

## Gerrard Milburn - The thermodynamics of time and learning
- what do clocks do?
They measure coincidences between local events here and now. Must specify the temperature of the local environment
- Physical time is relational - time is always local.
- The larger the limit cycle the more regular the clock signal. But the larger the limit cycle the more energy is dissipated. 
- Good clocks are necessarily dissipative Erker PRX 2017
- Entropy increases into the future and into the past from the perspective of a local agent. Physical time is manifest time. 
- learning machines - they are driven to learn because that is the most efficient way to exploit their thermodynamic environment.
- Heat and entropy must be dissipated during training
- too much noise, random number generator basically
- quantum perceptron is a dissipative switch subject to quantum noise
- Thermodynamic efficiency of learning a rule in neural networks. Nothing done in the quantum case yet.
- Akil Seth - the brain isn’t a video recorder. It takes in what it observes, forms an emulation and continuously updates its own emulation based on more information input.
- What if communication between agents is more efficient than learning individually 
- Spiking is always a bit better
- what are the laws of physics


## Natalia Ares - Electrons and Mechanics
- semiconductor platforms are some of the best devices to investigate questions on quantum and mechanics
- semiconductors given you many options to couple quantum to mechanical effects
- slizard engine - electron driving a piston
- The thermodynamic cost of timekeeping
    - resource to drive them
    - heat to dissipate - waste
- silicon nitride membrane 50 atoms thick
- Drive the membrane with white noise - it acts as an effective temperature
- what is the thermodynamic cost of processing quantum information

## Tim Cook - Is Consciousness Physical?
Three questions
- Wigner’s friend
- Entanglement
- Teleportation

Does consciousness collapse quantum states?
- Ooh a qubit in a superposition state. If I observe it, i’ll project its state.
- Against measurement - John Bell. Would you get a better measurement if the person had a phd
- are frogs conscious - can frogs be entangled
- can consciousness be teleported
- you can’t have consciousness without learning but you can’t have learning without irreversibility.
